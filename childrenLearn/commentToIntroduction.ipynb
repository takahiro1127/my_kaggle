Competitors will be challenged to predict scores on in-game assessments and create an algorithm that will lead to better-designed games and improved learning outcomes. *\n\n**\nNote that this is a synchronous rerun code competition and the private test set has approximately 8MM rows. You should be mindful of memory in your notebooks to avoid submission errors.** 😅"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pylab as plt\nfrom IPython.display import HTML\nimport warnings\npd.set_option('max_columns', 100)\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\nsns.set_style(\"whitegrid\")\nmy_pal = sns.color_palette(n_colors=10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First we will see what files we are given to work with.
